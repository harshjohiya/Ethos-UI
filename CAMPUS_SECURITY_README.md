# Campus Entity Resolution Security Monitoring System

## Overview

This MVP is designed for a hackathon implementation to unify and analyze diverse campus data sources‚Äîincluding swipe logs, Wi-Fi records, bookings, helpdesk notes, and CCTV extracts‚Äîto track and resolve campus entities (students, staff, assets), reconstruct their activity histories, and proactively support campus security and operations teams with accessible insights and real-time alerts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Ethos-UI

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Demo Data
The system includes comprehensive synthetic data:
- **105 Campus Entities**: 50 students, 25 staff, 30 assets
- **500+ Activity Records**: Swipe logs, Wi-Fi connections, bookings, CCTV
- **15+ Security Alerts**: Missing entities, anomalous activities, unauthorized access
- **ML Predictions**: 20% of activities are ML-predicted with explanations

## Usage

2. Search and filter entities by type, status, or name
3. Click on any entity to view detailed information
4. Review the activity timeline with predictions
5. Analyze entity resolution confidence scores

### Security Monitoring
1. Go to the **Security** page
2. View real-time security metrics and charts
3. Filter data by time range and location
4. Review threat analysis and recommendations
5. Monitor alert severity distribution

### Alert Management
1. Access the **Alerts** page
2. Filter alerts by severity and status
3. Click on alerts to view detailed information
4. Acknowledge or resolve alerts as needed
5. Review alert analytics and response metrics

### System Configuration
1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Configure system, security, ML, and notification settings
3. Adjust privacy and data protection controls
4. Save changes to apply new configurations

## ML Prediction Engine

### How It Works
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes historical activity patterns
2. **Entity Type Modeling**: Different patterns for students, staff, and assets
